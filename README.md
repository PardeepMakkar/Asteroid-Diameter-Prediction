# Asteroid-Diameter-Prediction-with-various-ML-algorithms
In this project, I will try to predict the diameter of asteroid with various ML algorithms such as Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and XGboost Regressor. The data is downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter).
File size is too large to be uploaded. Please download the data from Kaggle.
The following steps are taken in this work:
1. Downloading a real-world dataset from a Kaggle
2. Understanding the dataset, formulating the problem and describing objective.
3. Performing a exploratory data analysis, gathering insights, creating a training, validation & test split and finally preparing the data for modeling.
4. Training & evaluating the different machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters to improve models.
5. Report of final performance of best model and showing sample predictions.
6. At last, summary of the work and links to references.
